Instructions & Notes

1. A real device is needed to test with, not a simulator. This is because the functionality utilises a microphone.
2. To run on a real device, you'll need to select your development team in the project settings.
3. The speech recogniser is set to recognise Australian English (my own native language) - due to time constraints. Try to speak in an Australian accent ;)
4. That's it - hopefully the UI is clear enough to not need further instructions!
